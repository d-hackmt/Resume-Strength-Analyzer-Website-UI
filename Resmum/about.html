      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This proposed system aims to solve the problem of users being unfamiliar with the skill sets and projects required for a particular job, and not knowing what needs to be included in their resume to meet job demands. The system, which uses NLP and deep learning techniques, will analyze resume content and predict the probability of getting placed.</p>
      <p>The primary focus will be on data roles, and the system will bridge the gap between the company's expectations and the user's capabilities by recommending which skill sets are most important according to the job role. It will also help categorize skill sets and highlight them in the resume.</p>
      <p>The system will be developed as an easy-to-use application tool for freshers and professionals who are looking to update their skill sets in their resumes. It will scrape data from online job portals and use it to train the model to understand the content. The system will be developed using Python and will incorporate MongoDB, Postgres, TensorFlow, NLTK, Spacy, FastAPI, Docker, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Scrappy, Selenium, and Cloud technologies.</p>
      <p>The development process will involve data scraping, data cleaning, database management, API development, NLP, web development, deployment into a cloud service, and CI/CD. Although it may take a long time to develop, this application will be very useful for students and job seekers, and will help them create a robust and relevant resume that is tailored to the specific job requirements.</p>
